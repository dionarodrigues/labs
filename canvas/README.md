This is a list of experiments using canvas that I developed while taking [this course](https://www.awwwards.com/academy/course/creative-coding-2-0-in-js-animation-sound-color).

- [canvas-sketch dependency](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)

## Run the experiments

In order to run the experiments, first install the Node dependencies, then you can use the global [canvas-sketch-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-sketch-cli) command or `npx canvas-sketch-cli` plus `--open [filename]`:

- `npx canvas-sketch-cli --open sketch-particles.js`
- `npx canvas-sketch-cli --open sketch-particles-2.js`
- `npx canvas-sketch-cli --open sketch-curves-intro.js`

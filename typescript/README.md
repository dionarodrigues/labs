**A Typescript experiment using Class, [Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html), [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) and more to build a simple system to add projects via form. It also contains drag and drop functionality to move projects between Active and Finished areas.**
